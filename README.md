# Pokel

Inspired by Wordle—guess the Pokémon by entering Pokémon names. Your guesses can be any length, but must be no longer than the Pokémon name you are trying to guess, and must be real Pokémon names.

TODO:
There is currently no way to select the generation/s you want to guess from via the UI. This is set in the onInit() method in gamescreen.component.ts.
